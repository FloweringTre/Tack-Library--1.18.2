# Tre's Tack Shop 
A hopeful attempt at making an addon to SWEM that expands the [Tack]Item classes for the community to use to add new textures to the game without overriding the orignal tack items. Also plans to include additional ribbon/trophy items for retexturing and item entities that appear like CIT models. 

Basically a little add-on mod that acts like a custom tack shop for players and servers to use to gain custom tack. 

*All items only be obtainable in the creative menu / give commands, there are no recipes in this mod*


# Note to resources pack makers
All tack items have two textures attached to them, the texture on the horse and the icon in the menus/inventory. To change rendered horse textures, you must replace the numbered png file in the ***swem*** assets folder. To change the icon textures, you must replace the numbered png file in the ***tretackshop*** assets folder.

*I plan to share a ready-made texture pack template once this is ready to share.*
