# Tre-Tack-Shop 
A hopeful attempt at making an addon to SWEM that expands the [Tack]Item classes for the community to use to add new
textures to the game without overriding the orignal tack items. 

Also plans to include additional ribbon/trophy items for retexturing and item entities that appear like CIT models.
basically a little add-on mod that makes a custom tack shop for players and servers to use to gain custom tack. 

**All items only be obtainable in the creative menu / give commands, there are no recipes in this mod**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Note to resources pack makers
All tack items have two textures attached to them, the texture on the horse and the icon in the menus/inventory. 
To change rendered horse textures, you must replace the numbered png file in the SWEM assets folder. 
To change the icon textures, you must replaced the numbered png file in the TRETACKSHOP assets folder.

***I plan to share a ready-made texture pack template once this is ready to share.***
